\title{Helper function for lipid intensity filtering}
\usage{
lipidIntensityFilteringHelper(
  assay_table,
  min_lipid_intensity_threshold,
  lipids_proportion_of_samples_below_cutoff,
  lipid_id_column
)

lipidIntensityFilteringHelper(
  assay_table,
  min_lipid_intensity_threshold,
  lipids_proportion_of_samples_below_cutoff,
  lipid_id_column
)
}
\arguments{
\item{assay_table}{A wide data frame where rows are lipids and columns include a lipid identifier and numeric sample intensities.}

\item{min_lipid_intensity_threshold}{The calculated minimum intensity value. Lipids in samples below this threshold are considered 'below threshold'.}

\item{lipids_proportion_of_samples_below_cutoff}{The maximum allowed proportion (0 to 1) of samples where a lipid can be below the threshold. If a lipid exceeds this proportion, it's removed.}

\item{lipid_id_column}{A string specifying the name of the column containing the unique lipid identifiers.}
}
\value{
A filtered wide data frame containing only the lipids that pass the filter.

A filtered wide data frame containing only the lipids that pass the filter.

\description{
Filter lipids based on an intensity threshold and the proportion of samples below that threshold in a wide-format table.
