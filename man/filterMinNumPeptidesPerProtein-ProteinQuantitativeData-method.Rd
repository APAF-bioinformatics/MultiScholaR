\title{Filter Proteins Based on Minimum Peptide and Peptidoform Evidence}
\usage{
\S4method{filterMinNumPeptidesPerProtein}{ProteinQuantitativeData}(theObject, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{theObject}{A ProteinQuantitativeData object that has been processed by
\code{proteinMissingValueImputationLimpa} from a \code{PeptideQuantitativeData} object.}

\item{num_peptides_per_protein_thresh}{Minimum number of unique peptides
required per protein (default: 1).}

\item{num_peptidoforms_per_protein_thresh}{Minimum number of total peptidoforms
(i.e., total peptide rows before summarization) required per protein (default: 2).}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A filtered ProteinQuantitativeData object with proteins not meeting
the thresholds removed.
}
\description{
Filters protein-level data based on the minimum number of unique peptides and
total peptidoforms that were used to quantify each protein. This function
relies on a summary table created during the \code{proteinMissingValueImputationLimpa}
step and stored in the object. It is a critical quality control step to ensure
that retained proteins have sufficient evidence supporting their quantification.
