\arguments{
\item{theObject}{A PeptideQuantitativeData object}

\item{imputed_value_column}{Name for the new column containing imputed values.
Default is "Peptide.Imputed.Limpa"}

\item{use_log2_transform}{Whether to log2 transform the data before imputation.
Default is TRUE (recommended by limpa)}

\item{dpc_method}{Method for DPC estimation. Default is "eb" (empirical Bayes)}

\value{
Updated PeptideQuantitativeData object with imputed values

\description{
This function uses the limpa package's detection probability curve (DPC) approach
for sophisticated missing value imputation specifically designed for proteomics data.
This method is more robust than traditional imputation as it models the missing value
mechanism based on detection probabilities.
}
\details{
The limpa package uses a detection probability curve (DPC) to model the relationship
between peptide intensity and the probability of detection. This allows for more
sophisticated imputation that accounts for the intensity-dependent nature of missing
values in proteomics data, rather than assuming they are missing at random.

The process follows these steps:
\enumerate{
\item Estimate the detection probability curve using dpc()
\item Perform row-wise imputation using dpcImpute()
\item Transform results back to original scale if needed
}
}
