This function applies limpa's DPC-based missing value imputation directly to
protein-level quantification data. This is useful when you already have protein
quantification data with missing values that need to be handled.

\details{
This method treats each protein as a separate "feature" and applies DPC-based
imputation using limpa's dpcImpute function. This is appropriate when you have
protein-level data with missing values that follow intensity-dependent patterns.
