)
}
\arguments{
\item{design_matrix}{The design matrix with the sample ID in one column and the experimental group in another column}

\item{sample_id_column}{The name of the column with the sample ID, tidyverse style input.}

\item{group_column}{The name of the column with the experimental group, tidyverse style input.}

\item{temp_column}{The name of the temporary column that indicates which samples are biological replicates of the same experimental group.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with rows as samples, columns as experimental group, and a value of 1 for samples within the same experimental group represented by the same column, and a value of zero otherwise.
