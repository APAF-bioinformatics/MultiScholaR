\title{Calculate Adaptive Maximum Acceptable K Based on Sample Size}
\usage{
calculateAdaptiveMaxK(sample_size)

calculateAdaptiveMaxK(sample_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_size}{Number of samples in the dataset}
}
\value{
An integer representing the adaptive max_acceptable_k value

An integer representing the adaptive max_acceptable_k value
}
\description{
Internal helper function to determine an appropriate max_acceptable_k value
based on the number of samples in the dataset. This prevents over-correction
in small datasets and allows more flexibility in large datasets.

\details{
The adaptive calculation follows these principles:
\itemize{
\item Small datasets (n < 15): Conservative approach, max_k = 2
\item Medium datasets (n = 15-40): Standard approach, max_k = 3
\item Large datasets (n = 40-80): Moderate approach, max_k = 4
\item Very large datasets (n > 80): Permissive approach, max_k = 5
}

The rationale is that with more samples, you have more degrees of freedom
and statistical power, making higher k values less problematic.
