\title{Extract Substrings from Underscore-Separated Strings}
\usage{
extract_experiment(x, mode = "range", start = 1, end = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector containing the strings to process}

\item{mode}{Character string specifying extraction mode:
\itemize{
\item "range": Extract elements between two underscore positions
\item "start": Extract from start to first underscore
\item "end": Extract from last underscore to end
}}

\item{start}{Integer: Starting position for range mode (1-based)}

\item{end}{Integer: Ending position for range mode (1-based, required for range mode)}
}
\value{
Character vector with extracted strings. Returns NA for strings where
requested positions are out of bounds.
}
\description{
Extracts substrings from underscore-separated strings using different modes:
range (between positions), start (first element), or end (last element).
}
\examples{
x <- "20140602_ffs_expt1_r1_junk"
extract_experiment(x, mode = "range", start = 1, end = 3)  # "20140602_ffs_expt1"
extract_experiment(x, mode = "start")  # "20140602"
extract_experiment(x, mode = "end")    # "junk"

# Multiple strings
x <- c("20140602_ffs_expt1_r1_junk", "20140603_ffs_expt2_r2_test")
extract_experiment(x, mode = "range", start = 2, end = 3)  # c("ffs_expt1", "ffs_expt2")
