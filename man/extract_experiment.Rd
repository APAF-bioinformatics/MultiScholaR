\title{Extract Substrings from Underscore-Separated Strings}
\usage{
extract_experiment(x, mode = "range", start = 1, end = NULL)

extract_experiment(x, mode = "range", start = 1, end = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector containing the strings to process}

\item{mode}{Character string specifying extraction mode:
\itemize{
\item "range": Extract elements between two underscore positions
\item "start": Extract from start to first underscore
\item "end": Extract from last underscore to end
}}

\item{start}{Integer: Starting position for range mode (1-based)}

\item{end}{Integer: Ending position for range mode (1-based, required for range mode)}
}
\value{
Character vector with extracted strings. Returns NA for strings where
requested positions are out of bounds.

requested positions are out of bounds.
}
\description{
Extracts substrings from underscore-separated strings using different modes:
range (between positions), start (first element), or end (last element).
