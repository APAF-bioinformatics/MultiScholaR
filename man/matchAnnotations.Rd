\description{
Matches protein identifiers from differential expression results
with UniProt annotations, enriching the DE results with gene names and other
annotation information.

Matches protein identifiers from differential expression results
with UniProt annotations, enriching the DE results with gene names and other
annotation information.
}
\details{
This function performs fuzzy matching between protein identifiers in DE results
and UniProt entries. It handles common protein ID formats including:
\itemize{
\item UniProt accessions (P12345)
\item UniProt accessions with isoform suffixes (P12345-1)
\item Protein group IDs separated by semicolons
}

The function first attempts exact matching, then falls back to partial matching
by removing isoform suffixes and taking the first protein ID from groups.
