\arguments{
\item{normalised_protein_matrix_obj}{A ProteinQuantitativeData object containing
the normalized protein quantification data}

\item{percentage_range}{A numeric vector specifying the range of percentages to test.
Default is seq(1, 20, by = 1) for testing 1\% to 20\% in 1\% increments}

\item{num_components_to_impute}{Number of components to use for imputation in ruvCancor.
Default is 5}

\item{ruv_grouping_variable}{The grouping variable to use for RUV analysis.
Default is "group"}

\item{ruv_qval_cutoff}{The FDR threshold for negative control selection.
Default is 0.05}

\item{ruv_fdr_method}{The FDR calculation method. Default is "qvalue"}

\item{separation_metric}{The metric to use for evaluating separation quality.
Options: "max_difference" (default), "mean_difference", "auc", "weighted_difference"}

\item{k_penalty_weight}{Weight for penalizing high k values in composite score.
Default is 0.5. Higher values penalize high k more strongly}

\item{max_acceptable_k}{Maximum acceptable k value. k values above this get heavy penalty.
Default is 3}

\item{adaptive_k_penalty}{Whether to automatically adjust max_acceptable_k based on sample size.
Default is TRUE (recommended). Set to FALSE only if you need exact reproducibility with previous results}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print progress messages. Default is TRUE}
}

\item best_control_genes_index: The control genes index for the best percentage
\item best_separation_score: The separation score for the best percentage
\item best_composite_score: The composite score (separation penalized by k value)

This function automatically determines the optimal percentage of proteins to use
as negative controls for RUV-III analysis by testing different percentages and
evaluating the separation quality between "All" and "Control" groups in canonical
correlation plots.
