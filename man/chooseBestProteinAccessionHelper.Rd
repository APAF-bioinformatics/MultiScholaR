\usage{
chooseBestProteinAccessionHelper(
  input_tbl,
  acc_detail_tab,
  accessions_column,
  row_id_column = "uniprot_acc",
  group_id,
  delim = ":"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_tbl}{Contain the following columns, 'group_id' which is the Id for each protein group, 'accessions_column' which is the column with the accession of the protein}

\item{accessions_column}{The name of the column with the list of protein accessions, separated by ';' semi-colon. No need to quote the name as we are using tidyverse programming quosure.}

\item{group_id}{The name of the column with the group ID for each protein group. No need to quote the name as we are using tidyverse programming quosure.}

\item{acc_detail_tabl}{The out table from running the function 'parseFastaFile'}
}
\value{
A table with the following columns:
maxquant_row_id: Row ID
num_gene_names: Number of gene names associated with this row ID
gene_names: The gene names
uniprot_acc: List of uniprot accessions, but with the list ordered by the best one to less useful one to use
is_unique: Is the protein group assined to a unique UniProt accession or multiple UniProt accessions
}
\description{
From a list of UniProt accessions, choose the best accession to use based on the UniProt score for quality of annotation for the protein entries
}
