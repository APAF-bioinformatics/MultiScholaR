\usage{
convertEnsemblToUniprot(ensembl_ids, organism_code)

convertEnsemblToUniprot(ensembl_ids, organism_code)
}
\arguments{
\item{ensembl_ids}{Character vector of Ensembl protein IDs (with or without version suffixes)}

\item{organism_code}{Character string with gprofiler2 organism code (e.g., "hsapiens", "oaries")}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item original_id: Original Ensembl protein ID (with version suffix if provided)
\item converted_id: Converted UniProt accession (NA if no match)
\item conversion_status: "success" or "failed"
\item n_targets: Number of UniProt IDs found for this Ensembl ID
}

\description{
Uses gprofiler2::gconvert() to convert Ensembl protein IDs
to UniProt/SwissProt accessions. Automatically strips version suffixes
(e.g., .1, .2) before conversion and maps results back to original IDs.

}
\details{
This function uses gprofiler2's gene identifier conversion service.

\strong{Version Suffix Handling:}
\itemize{
\item Ensembl IDs with version suffixes (e.g., ENSOARP00020006936.1) are automatically
stripped before conversion
\item Results are mapped back to original IDs with versions preserved
}

\strong{Multiple Matches:}
\itemize{
\item Some Ensembl IDs may map to multiple UniProt IDs
\item In such cases, the first match is returned (gprofiler2 orders by relevance)
}
