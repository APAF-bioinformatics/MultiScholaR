\title{Analyze Organism Distribution in Proteomics Data}
\usage{
analyzeOrganismDistribution(protein_ids, organism_mapping)
}
\arguments{
\item{protein_ids}{Character vector of protein IDs from search results}

\item{organism_mapping}{Tibble from extractOrganismsFromFasta() with
columns: uniprot_acc, organism_name, taxon_id}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\item{organism_name}{Name of the organism}
\item{taxon_id}{NCBI taxonomy ID}
\item{protein_count}{Number of proteins matched to this organism}
\item{percentage}{Percentage of total proteins}
\item{rank}{Rank by protein count (1 = highest)}
}
\description{
Analyzes the distribution of proteins across different organisms
by matching protein IDs from search results against FASTA organism annotations.
Used to identify the primary organism in mixed-species databases.
