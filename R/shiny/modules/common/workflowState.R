#' @title WorkflowState
#' @description An R6 class to manage the state of a multi-step workflow.
#'
#' @details This class is designed to track the state of data objects (specifically S4 objects)
#' as they are processed through a series of transformations in a Shiny app. It allows for
#' saving named states, retrieving them, and reverting to previous states, which is essential
#' for creating a non-linear, interactive analysis workflow.
#'
#' It works by storing copies of data objects in a list, acting as a "save game"
#' feature for the analysis.
