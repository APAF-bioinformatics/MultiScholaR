# ProteomeRiver

Tools for Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics analysis. 

## Getting Started

git clone repository 
```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:cmri-bioinformatics/proteomeriver.git
```

### Prerequisites

R version 3.6.3 (>=). 

## Installation

Edit `config.mk` file. Change `REXEC` and `PREFIX` as necessary. 

Install the R package and R scripts using make:
```
make install 
```
Add the scripts `PATH` as indicated in the command line. See all make options:
``` 
make help
```

## Usage
ProteomeRiver consists of several command line scripts. You can create a config.ini script with all the parameters and run the script sequentially:

```
clean_proteins_cmd.R -c config.ini
de_analysis_cmd.R -c config.ini
annot_proteins_cmd.R -c config.ini
```

Typical directory structure of your project should look like:

``` 

# General results folder 
cache
Reactome
UniProt

# Proteomics results folder 
clean_proteins
de_proteins
annot_proteins
prot_publication_graphs
proteins_pathways_enricher

# Phosphoproteomics results folder 
clean_phos
de_phos
annot_phos
phos_publication_graphs
norm_phos_by_prot_abundance
phos_pathways_enricher
phos_kinswingr_ST

```
