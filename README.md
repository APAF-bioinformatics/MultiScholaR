# ProteomeScholaR v0.8

## v0.8 provides a feature complete workflow for processing searched DIA-NN proteomics data.

Download data and directory structure from <<here>>.

Unzip.

Open R studio and set folder as Project.

Copy DIA_workflow_1.0.rmd and DIA_report_1.0.rmd  to the Project folder and open inside R studio.

Run the workflow, use the Shiny app to define your experimental design, contrasts and linear model you wish to use.

Proceed chunk by chunk.

Run DIA_report_1.0.rmd and generate a document that will dynamically produce a shareable report for your analysis.

All the results are in the summary_results folder in the project root directory.

Do the science :)

Enjoy!
